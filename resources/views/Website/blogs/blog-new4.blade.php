                                            in-person education, online learning may lack face-to-face interaction with
                                            peers and instructors. Some learners thrive in a collaborative environment,
                                            and the absence of in-person communication can make it difficult to build
                                            relationships, ask questions, or engage in real-time discussions. Virtual
                                            communication tools can help bridge this gap, but it may not fully replicate
                                            the experience of being physically present.</p>

                                                effective time management skills. Balancing coursework, assignments, and
